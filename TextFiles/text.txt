It sits unremarkably in a gray safe in a climate-controlled room: the first ledger of the Porsche
design office, stored in a fireproof room in the archive of the Porsche Museum. In the timeworn
ledger one can find order number 1, placed on August 21, 1930.
In early 1933, the Porsche design office received a commission from Auto Union to develop
a sixteen-cylinder race car according to the rules of the 750-kilogram racing formula. In December of 1932,
months before concluding the contract, the Porsche team began work on the Type 22 mid-engine P race car.
The legendary Auto Union Grand Prix car set new standards.
